Create an EC2 instance
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service) offering from AWS - you can rent out
servers with customizable memory, storage and bandwidth. These servers can then be used for purposes hosting
your applications, which is exactly what we’re going to do.

SSH(Secure Socket Shell) is a network protocol that allows you to sign in to your servers from a 
remote computer. You might have seen SSH referred to on GitHub - "Clone using HTTPS or SSH". Here, 
we use SSH to securely log in to the server, using the pem file we have.
# Usually downloads go to ~/Downloads/
chmod 400 <path-to-your-pem-file>
ssh -i "crio-demo.pem" ubuntu@<your-ec2-url>
# Example
ssh -i "~/Downloads/crio-demo.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-233-100-101.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
You’ll find your EC2 URL under the heading ‘Public IPv4 DNS’

Deploying app backend server
You will be deploying the app backend for QEats app - which is a Swiggy/UberEats like food-ordering app.
Once you start the backend server, you can connect to it from your app anywhere in the world and have some 
fun.
Installing Docker
APT is a packet manager in Linux. The following instructions are similar to installing an EXE file in 
windows or an app in Android.
Type the following instructions the AWS instance terminal 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wget
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo service docker start
newgrp docker
sudo apt install -y telnet
sudo docker run -d -m 800m -v /tmp/container:/tmp:rw -p 8081:8081 criodo/qeats-server

Think of Docker Hub as an App store for docker images. For the purposes of this Byte, 
you don’t have to understand all the docker instructions,
Type telnet localhost 8081 from the same AWS instance and you should see the following
output if everything worked fine -

Telnet is a network protocol used to virtually access a computer and to provide a two-way, collaborative and text-based...

Cloud
Buzz word that everyone uses, but is a very simple concept. In very simple terms,
Cloud is a bunch of hardware resources like storage or compute that someone maintains for you.
Eg: Apple maintains your photos in iCloud instead of your harddisk, 
AWS provides you with a server (think desktop computer) to host your website instead of doing it
from a machine at your house.

AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most popular cloud service providers out in the market. 
They provide different kinds of services for companies and individuals.

Some of the popular offerings from AWS are:

Virtual machines (EC2)

VM - in simple terms, computers with some configuration; eg: 2cpu, 16GB RAM, 20 GB hard disk
Storage (S3)
Load Balancers (ELB)
You’ll be using AWS EC2 virtual machines in this Byte.

Docker
Docker is a containerization technology - you can think of them as tiny VMs. You don’t have to know the
details of docker for this Byte. But feel free to dig deeper if you are curious - find our bytes

GET
GET requests are used to "get" resources from a server. 
Check the requests made when you visit https://gitlab.crio.do/users/sign_in in Incognito.
If we check the first request made, it’s for a resource of type document which is the HTML file. Use the Preview tab to see the HTML rendered. 
Is it missing something? yes it was missing
Goto the Response tab & you’ll be able to see the raw HTML data. You’ll be able to see <img> tags. 
Why aren't the images showing up in the Preview tab then?
As we saw earlier, we can only specify a single resource in the HTTP request-line at a time meaning 
that we need a separate HTTP request for fetching any related files (image, css, javascript) the HTML needs.
Find out an image included in the HTML (look for <img> tags). Can you see a HTTP request for that resource?

POST
POST requests are used to send some data to the server. 
Some use cases are to submit data from a web form or to upload a file to the server.

PUT
PUT requests are used to update data on the server side. This could be for actions
like changing your Facebook relationship status, updating a student’s marks on the 
college server after improvement exams etc.

DevTools Networks tab and ensure you’ve the Preserve log option checked.

The cURL utility
cURL is like a web-browser, but for the command line.You can make HTTP requests
using cURL just like in a web-browser. The Response can be seen on the command line or redirected to a file.

curl -X GET https://www.flipkart.com -o ~/flipkart.html
output will be show in flipkart.html
In the above curl request, -X allows you to specify the HTTP method to be used.
curl -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html You should see the 301 Moved Permanently reponse; just like in Chrome Developer Tools
We can also print the HTTP Response Headers using this: curl -i -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html Now, you should see the full
Response Headers as well.
If you also want the full details, try the following command: 
curl -v -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html A verbose log is printed. 
You can get the IP Address and the port number from the console output this time.
You can also instruct curl to follow the Redirect uRL automatically using the -L switch
curl -v -L -X GET http://www.flipkart.com -o flipkart.html # still using http and not https


Postman (Optional)
Postman is a powerful GUI based application that lets us make HTTP requests easily. 
To start with, create a new Request in Postman.

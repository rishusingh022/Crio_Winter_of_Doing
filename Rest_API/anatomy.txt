Components of a REST API Request
Use Chrome’s Developer Tools to monitor the API request made. Let’s look at the different components of the REST API request.
Request URL: https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query=san
Request Method: GET which denotes the type of HTTP request made. GET means data needs to be fetched.
Request Headers: eg: accept, accept-encoding - used to send additional info like the type of encoding that the requesting application (browser) supports
Request Body: is empty for the current request but can be used for sending additional information like a file’s content when uploading it to the server.

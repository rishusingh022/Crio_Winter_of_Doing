REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.

API stands for Application Programming Interface, and unfortunately, people will ask you the meaning of each 
word here. An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. You don’t go into a cafe and walk straight into the
kitchen to tell the chef what you wanna eat. The waiter does that for you, and that’s exactly what an API
is - with the client being you, the customer and any resource that can send data, being the chef.

REST APIs are those APIs which follow the guidelines set by the REST architecture. They follow a 
client-server model where one software program sends a request and the other responds with some data. 
REST APIs commonly use the HTTP protocol to send requests & receive responses.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation - how cryptic :| ) is a standard format that is easily "understandable"
by applications and can be handled well in most languages. So the data format in REST is usually JSON. 
For example, an Android app can effortlessly utilize data sent by a Node.js server. XML is another popular 
format for data transfer between applications.

As we discussed earlier, REST API calls are made on top of the HTTP protocol. We can analyse the network
packets during the API calls to confirm this using Wireshark.
Wireshark is a popular network analysis tool to capture network packets and display them at a granular level.
Once these packets are broken down, you can use them for real-time or offline analysis.

We have learnt what REST API is by running some of the APIs.

APIs makes it easier for

Other applications to avail those services.

Integration is easier, only the API definitions need to be exposed.
The internet is full of such APIs and the knowledge of APIs will help you utilize these services as well as to develop new ones of your own
